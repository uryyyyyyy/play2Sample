# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.
#
# You can include other configuration files in this main application.conf file:
#include "extra-config.conf"

## Akka

# Play uses Akka internally and exposes Akka Streams and actors in Websockets and
# other streaming HTTP responses.

  # <logger name="akka.actor" level="INFO" />
